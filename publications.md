### First author publication
1.	[Aerosols impact on optical satellite transmission](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42496-019-00018-1) (Gressier and Kaillault Aerotecnica Missili & Spazio, Associazione italiana di aeronautica e astronautica, 2019, 98 (3), pp.207-219.)

2.	[Near-Infrared transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 h using Hubble WFC3 G141](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/02/aa42140-21/aa42140-21.html) (Gressier et al. 2022 Astronomy & Astrophysics Volume 658, id.A133, 25 pp). 
_This paper presents the first Hubble WFC3 G141 transmission spectrum of a cold, rocky planet, TRAPPIST-1 h. I extracted and corrected the three raw transit observations using the pipeline iraclis. I give the first atmospheric constraint using a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval code. This planet is unlikely to bear a H/He clear dominated atmosphere, but a cloudy/hazy light atmosphere can not be ruled out. The planet might have lost its atmosphere or possesses a secondary N2 or CO2-rich atmosphere_.
