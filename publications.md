### First author publication
1.	[Aerosols impact on optical satellite transmission](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42496-019-00018-1) (Gressier and Kaillault Aerotecnica Missili & Spazio, Associazione italiana di aeronautica e astronautica, 2019, 98 (3), pp.207-219.)

2.	[Near-Infrared transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 h using Hubble WFC3 G141](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/02/aa42140-21/aa42140-21.html) (Gressier et al. 2022 Astronomy & Astrophysics Volume 658, id.A133, 25 pp). 
_This paper presents the first Hubble WFC3 G141 transmission spectrum of a cold, rocky planet, TRAPPIST-1 h. I extracted and corrected the three raw transit observations using the pipeline iraclis. I give the first atmospheric constraint using a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval code. This planet is unlikely to bear a H/He clear dominated atmosphere, but a cloudy/hazy light atmosphere can not be ruled out. The planet might have lost its atmosphere or possesses a secondary N2 or CO2-rich atmosphere_.

3.  [The Hubble PanCET Program: The near-UV transmission spectrum of WASP-79 b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08962) (Gressier et al. 2023a Astronomy & Astrophysics). 
_This paper presents a method to decorrelate the systematics noise from the transit signal and fit light curves of near-UV Hubble STIS E230M observations. I apply the technique to WASP-121 b's observations and confirm the photo-evaporation of its atmosphere previously detected by Sing et al. 2019. Besides, I analysed two unprecedented transit observations of WASP-79 b and observed an increase in the planet-to-star radius ratio at short wavelengths. The difference between the radius ratios at 2400Å and 3000Å reaches 0.0191±0.0042 (4.5 sigma). Although the NUV transmission spectrum does not show evidence of hydrodynamical escape, the strong atmospheric features are likely due to species at very high altitudes. The comparison of WASP-79 b's transmission spectrum with three other warmer Hot-Jupiters shows a similar absorption level to WASP-178 b and WASP-121 b._

4. Population study: Exploring the transition from Super-Earth to Sub-Neptune with a Hubble transmission survey (Gressier et al. 2023b submitted to A&A). 
_In this work I present the first large-scale consistent Hubble WFC3 G141 transmission survey of Super-Earth and Sub-Neptunes. I collected 26 transmission spectra of planets smaller than 6REarth . All transmission spectra are obtained using the same pipeline, iraclis and consistently analysed using a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval code, Tau-REx. I present a model comparison method to quantify atmospheric and molecular detections. I confirmed, the detection of an atmosphere for 13 planets with a radius larger than 1.7REarth and detected water vapour with high confidence for nine planets. The most striking result is the absence of methane detection in Sub-Neptune atmospheres. I evaluate the impact of KCl and Na2S clouds on the water feature amplitude around 1.4microns using self-consistent simulations with Exo-REM. I built a grid of model spanning the metallicity, temperature and cloud coverage. We confirmed the retrieval results and refined the nature of clouds in Sub-Neptune atmospheres. We concluded that we could not fit flat spectra with radiative clouds only and that photochemical hazes are probably responsible for low water amplitudes in the atmosphere of Sub-Neptunes between 500 and 800 K. For smaller planets, although the HST data cannot be used to distinguish a light atmosphere with clouds from a high mean molecular weight atmosphere, I have shown by performing telescope simulations for the James Webb Space Telescope and the future ESA-Ariel space mission that the extended wavelength range and increasing spectral resolution will allow to distinguish those scenarios.__
